## Tools Used
* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) -  As the Repo name would suggest, we used React! Check it out if you haven't!
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) - To use Yarn commands, you should download & install it before running through the "Getting Started" section above. Alternatively you can use node and run ``` npm intall ```.
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - Webpack is required to bundle together the .jsx files as well as a few other things together.
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - This is a Javascript compiler which allows you to use ES2015 and the latest features that aren't supported by browsers yet.
* [Eslint](http://eslint.org/) - A linting tool for Javascript
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - Never worry about ugly code again, Prettier will format it the same consistent way every time.
